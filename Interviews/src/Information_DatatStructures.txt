LinkedList:

List of advantages :

Linked List is Dynamic data Structure .
Linked List can grow and shrink during run time.
Insertion and Deletion Operations are Easier
Efficient Memory Utilization ,i.e no need to pre-allocate memory
Faster Access time,can be expanded in constant time without memory overhead
Linear Data Structures such as Stack,Queue can be easily implemeted using Linked list

Disadvantages of Linked List
Memory Usage
More memory is required to store elements in linked list as compared to array. Because in linked list each node contains a pointer and it requires extra memory for itself.
Traversal
Elements or nodes traversal is difficult in linked list. We can not randomly access any element as we do in array by index. For example if we want to access a node at position n then we have to traverse all the nodes before it. So, time required to access a node is large.
Reverse Traversing
In linked list reverse traversing is really difficult. In case of doubly linked list its easier but extra memory is required for back pointer hence wastage of memory.
